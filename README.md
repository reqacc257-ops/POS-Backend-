# Modern POS System - Railway Deployment Guide

This is a modern Point of Sale (POS) system built with Django REST Framework and React, now configured for Railway deployment.

## System Overview

- **Backend**: Django REST Framework API
- **Frontend**: React application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Railway.app

## Railway Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. Railway account (https://railway.app)
2. GitHub repository connected to Railway
3. PostgreSQL database

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Railway dashboard:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
DB_PASSWORD=your-postgres-password
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@yourdomain.com
```

### Database Setup

1. Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway
2. Railway will automatically set database connection variables
3. Update `DATABASES` configuration in `core/settings.py` if needed

### Build Commands

**Backend (Python Service):**
```
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: gunicorn core.wsgi:application
```

**Frontend (Static Site):**
```
Build Command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: frontend/build
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Create Services**: Railway will auto-detect and create services
3. **Configure Environment**: Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. **Add Database**: Install PostgreSQL plugin
5. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically deploy on git push

### Post-Deployment

1. **Run Migrations**: 
   ```bash
   railway ssh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create Superuser**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Update API URL**: Update frontend API configuration to point to your Railway backend URL
